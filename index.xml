Hope it will be better than past years&amp;hellip;
Anyway, I'm planning to talk a little bit about what I will do in the future as I will manage IoT projects starting next week. I will try to share my experience discovering this world, implementing and managing sensors in the wild. It will be Azure related and as I do not know much about IoT on Azure, this will be for sure super interesting - at least for me ;-)</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://pierre.chalamet.net/pages/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 22:43:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://pierre.chalamet.net/pages/about/</guid><description>My name is Pierre Chalamet and this is my personal blog.
Probably more information can be found on LinkedIn. If you want to get in touch with me, I guess you will find my email somewhere on the web.
