My name is Pierre Chalamet and this is my personal blog.

I'm the owner of [Magnus Opera SAS](https://magnusopera.io) and acting as CTO or VP Engineering for my employers.\
Probably more information can be found on [LinkedIn](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/pierrechalamet).\
If you want to get in touch with me, best is still [LinkedIn](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/pierrechalamet) to get in touch.

My day-to-day job is to manage people and projects and help structure teams. I consider myself hands-on. Few things I love to play with:
* F#, C# - it's been a while I've stop using unmanaged languages, I miss this sometimes for low-level stuff
* Golang
* Multithreading
* Distributed systems
* Performance
* Amiga and #demoscene

Beside work, I have some OSS projets too:
* [full-build](http://www.full-build.io): a smart build system for .net
* [cassandra-sharp](https://github.com/pchalamet/cassandra-sharp) : high performance .net driver for Cassandra

Also I'm happy to contribute back to OSS projects when possible. Also see [GitHub](https://github.com/pchalamet) for more projects.

I used to create demo when I was younger üê•\
Some of my old demos with [DreamDealers](http://demozoo.org/groups/739/) are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pchalamet/Dreamdealers).
