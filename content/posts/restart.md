So here I am... restarting this blog again (must be the 4th or 5th I guess). Hope it will be better than past years...

Anyway, I'm planning to talk a little bit about what I will do in the future as I will manage IoT projects starting next week. I will try to share my experience discovering this world, implementing and managing sensors in the wild. It will be Azure related and as I do not know much about IoT on Azure, this will be for sure super interesting.

On personal projects, I will restart [full-build](https://www.full-build.io) and finish port to .net core. I'm planning to implement following features:
* .net core (new project style only)
* Paket support removal
* use NuGet as binary outputs

Just asking myself if I should restart this project using Golang or continue with F#...

For 2020, I also plan to complete implementation of a new 3d engine for Amiga and hopefully release a demo with this engine. I started this project 2 years ago with a friend but I stopped working on this due to lack of motivation and time.

Let's see how this will turn ;-)
